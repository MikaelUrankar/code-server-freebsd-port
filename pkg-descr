This is a port of code-server which allows you to run VS Code on any machine
anywhere and access it in the browser. Code-server takes the open source core
of VS Code and allows you to run it in the browser.

Code-server requires Node.js to build and run. This port also installs an rc.d
script to allow for easy control as a service and start on boot.
